        <h1 style="color:red">Jabberwocky</h1>
        <h2>by Lewis Carrol</h2>

        <div>
            <pre>
    'Twas brillig, and the slithy toves

        Did gyre and gimble in the wabe:

    All mimsy were the borogoves,

      And the mome raths outgrabe.

 

    <i>"<b>Beware the Jabberwock, my son!</b>

        <b>The jaws that bite, the claws that catch!</b>

    Beware the Jubjub bird, and shun

    <b>The frumious Bandersnatch!</b>"</i>

 

    He took his vorpal sword in hand;

        Long time the manxome foe he soughtâ€”

    So rested he by the Tumtum tree

        And stood awhile in thought.
