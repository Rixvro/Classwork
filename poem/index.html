        <h1>Jabberwocky</h1>
        <h2>by Lewis Carrol</h2>

        <div>
           <pre>
'Twas brillig, and the slithy toves

    Did gyre and gimble in the wabe:
      
All mimsy were the borogoves,
      
    And the mome raths outgrabe.
      
       
      
"Beware the Jabberwock, my son!
      
    The jaws that bite, the claws that catch!
      
Beware the Jubjub bird, and shun
      
    The frumious Bandersnatch!"
      
       
      
He took his vorpal sword in hand;
      
    Long time the manxome foe he soughtâ€”
      
So rested he by the Tumtum tree
      
    And stood awhile in thought.
